Cynthia test - this only to my test branch on remote origin (and local)

make some changes and do a commit to 'test branch'

third, commit is not the same as pushing the local (committed) file back up to the remote (origin..forked) branch
so this time, right-click file and commit, then push (when tortoise dialog allows that option)
